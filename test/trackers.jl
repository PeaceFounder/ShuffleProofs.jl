# WIP on ensuring receipt freeness in pseudonymous voting
# Currently votes are not included and only tracxkers are considered. Implementing votes would require
# extending shuffle proof with ElGamalRow that could contain multiple elgamal elements
# The reuse of secret key x in decryption may expose it in ZKP. We need to be careful here!
